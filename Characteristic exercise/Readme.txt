characterisitics.m - solves an example problem from David Harris course. His comments is that the lengths should be smaller so that the process can be more iterative.

shock.m - solves an example problem from Nico Gray's course. The problem involves a two layer granular avalanche down a slope. 
Coordinates have been transformed into the frame of the travelling wave, such that the problem is steady.
Mixture theory is used to address the issue of the two layers, and the method of characteristics along with the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are used to determine
the final composition of phi concentrations.
