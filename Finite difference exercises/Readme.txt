All programs are solutions to problems from David Harris' PDE course.

4 codes are designed for the heat equation using differing approximations for the finite difference scheme.
1 is designed to highlight the stability constaints for an explicit method, by being unstable compared to the stable explicit version.


Finally there is a finite difference scheme for the wave equation. A first order approximation in space is taken for the first timestep so that 
we have the nessecary amount of information to apply a second order approximation in space and time for the remaining timesteps.
